	// dedup race that duplicates archived mail, which does not exist on this side: Meilisearch upserts
	// by document id and markIndexed is idempotent, so a second run of the same job costs work and

// pdf2json emitting an async "Bits per component missing in image" on a later tick, which no
// processor-level try/catch can catch. Without this, one such failure takes the process down.
// It does NOT re-run the offending job: an escaped rejection is disconnected from BullMQ, so that
// write is dropped. It is not lost for good — the row stays is_indexed=false and reconcile-index
// re-enqueues it. Ordinary errors thrown inside a job's promise are still rejected and retried by
// BullMQ as usual; only genuinely-escaped async failures land here.
//
// What this does NOT do, despite how it reads, is keep the WORKER alive. It keeps the PROCESS
// alive, and those are different things: BullMQ's run loop can be stopped while the process lives
// on, consuming nothing. superviseWorker() above is what catches that, by checking isRunning() and
// exiting so the supervisor can restart.
